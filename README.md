# ml-repo-template
Template repository representing a simple ml repository structure with branches dealing with both r&amp;d and productization.


This branch "main" represents the final productized and ready to build and deploy codebase.

It will be worked in and will accept pull requests from the develop branch

In case you were looking for some jupyter notebooks or other reasearch and development artifacts, please check out the "research_and_development" branch instead.
